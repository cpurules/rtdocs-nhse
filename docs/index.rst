==================================
Welcome to the NHSE documentation!
==================================

This is a user-created (i.e. unofficial) guide for using NHSE and covers both basic (e.g. inventory editing,
villager injection) and advanced (e.g. field editor) topics.

It should be noted that this is *not* an all-inclusive guide.  Many things (such as the number of bells in
your wallet) are clearly labeled in main menus and should not require instructions to change.  The NHSE wiki
also has some great information for basic editing.  Instead, this is aimed more at less-intuitive aspects of
NHSE, including editors that don't have explanations in the guide and information about what various fields
or flags mean.
